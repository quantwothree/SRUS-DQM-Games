Question 1: In your own words, describe what a Binary Search Tree (BST) is.
In addition, describe two important properties of a BST: depth and height. How are they different?

-> A binary search tree is a type of binary tree where the nodes follow an ordered structure.
That is, for every node:

-All the nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node’s value.
-All the nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node’s value.

-> A binary search tree's depth refers to the depth of its deepest node, where the depth of a node is defined by the number of 'connections' or 'lines' from that node to the root. 
-> A binary search tree's height refers to the number of 'connections' of the longest path from the root to a leaf, where a leaf is a node that does not have any children.
